                    <p>There are a number of ways you can prepare for TJCTF. First and foremost, make sure you have access to a Linux machine. Many of the binaries we will distribute will only run on certain architectures. If you do not already have an installation, you can install a virtual machine using <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player">VMware Player</a> or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a>. We recommend installing either good â€˜ol <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download">Ubuntu</a>, or the more powerful <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux</a>.</p>
                    <p>Once you have familiarized yourself with these platforms, there are a couple places you can visit for practice. <a href="http://picoctf.org">PicoCTF</a> has two years worth of challenges that you can try by signing up on their site. <a href="http://smashthestack.org/">Smash the Stack</a> is another great platform for practicing, with a variety of challenges for you to try. And, as with any CTF, remember that Google is your best friend.</p>
