                <p class="light grey-text text-darken-2">TJCTF is an online cybersecurity competition designed for high school students. Challenges will span various difficulty levels, so there will be problems for students who are new to computer science as well as those who are computer security experts.</p>

                <p class="light grey-text text-darken-2">Simple. Your team is given 3 days to solve as many challenges as possible, by finding a string called the "flag" after solving a puzzle. You'll know when you've found it. Each flag you find earns you points.</p>
