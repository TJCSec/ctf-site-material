                        <li><strong>No Outside Help.</strong> Using any resource that can be found on the web is fair play, but you may not ask anyone outside of your team for assistance. This includes, but is not limited to the sharing of flags, hints, methodology, or other problem aids. Minor offenders will get a warning, and major offenders will be disqualified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Only attack platforms that are designated as targets.</strong> Any attack, including DoS, on scoring or other infrastructure will not be tolerated. All attackable services will be clearly marked. We are not responsible for unauthorized attacks, and breaking this rule is grounds for disqualification and possible prosecution by outside organizations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competing teams may consist of up to 5 players, each an American citizen or resident, who is either attending high school in the US or 18 years of age or younger.</strong> Verification will be needed for winning teams. All teams must provide an adult contact at their school to vouch for their eligibility. Teams not in compliance with this will still be able to solve problems, but will not be able to win prizes or appear on scoreboards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Harassing other players through IRC or on social media will not be tolerated.</strong> Players being rude, inflammatory, or vulgar may be quieted or banned at the discretion of the moderators. Giving hints will result in a ban. This is a fun competition, but it is still educational, so appropriate behavior is expected.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enforcement and interpretation of rules will be at the sole discretion of the TJCTF organizers.</strong> Please see the official agreement for more information, or ask an organizer in IRC for clarification on the rules.</li>
